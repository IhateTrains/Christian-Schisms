- Merged e_byzantium and e_roman_empire tags. There's no reason to have two tags for the same state.
- Added a new flag based on the Chi-Rho symbol for the Roman Empire. Integrated from the Project Augustus mod.
- Added Michael III as the Roman Emperor in vanilla The Old Gods bookmark. Added a new bookmark called The Macedonian which focuses on Basil I. Integrated from the Project Augustus mod.
- Added relative localisation for the Roman Empire for more immersive gameplay:
	- If you play as a Catholic, Fraticelli or an Orthodox and your religious head is the Pope of Rome, the Roman Empire gets "Byzantine Empire" localisation.
	- If you play as anyone else, the Roman Empire gets "Roman Empire" localisation.
