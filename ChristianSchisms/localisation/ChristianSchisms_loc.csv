string_orthodox_DESC_1_chalcedonian;Chalcedonian Christianity is the main branch of Nicene Christianity that until the Council of Chalcedon in 451 was united with the Oriental Orthodox Churches. The Pope of Rome claims authority over the whole Church and tries to interfere in the affairs of other Patriarchs, but is recognized only as "first among equals" by them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
string_orthodox_DESC_2_post_schism_bookmark;The Orthodox Church is the other main branch of Chalcedonian Christianity that up until 1054 was formally united with the Catholic Church, although the political division can be traced back to the crowning of Charlemagne as Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III in 800, which did not sit well with the Emperor in Constantinople. The nominal head of the Orthodox Church is the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, but he does not interfere in the affairs of other Patriarchs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
