ERA_CHAR_NAME_70490;Michael III;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_70490;The last emperor from the Amorios dynasty, Michael III was not known for being particularly competent. He lacked administrative and diplomatic skills, and was unpopular with the people due to his contempt towards the church. He was murdered by Basil I on the 24th of September, 867, alongside several of his courtiers. Vicious rumours were spread about him after his death, mostly about his alleged alcoholism, but they were likely propaganda invented by his enemies.;;;;;;;;;x
