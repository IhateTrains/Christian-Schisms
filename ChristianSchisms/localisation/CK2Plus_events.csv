EVTNAME_Plus_2278;Two Roman Emperors?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2278;[Root.GetTitledName] has invoked the translatio imperii, and been given the blessing of Pope [current_roman_pope.GetFirstName] as the ruler of a Roman Empire reborn. This naturally does not sit well with [e_byzantium.Holder.GetTitledName], who maintains that the Pope does not have the right to bestow such a title. Indeed, the Pope doing so could imply either that [e_byzantium.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is not the *true* Roman [e_byzantium.Holder.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] or that [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has some manner of authority over [e_byzantium.Holder.GetHerHis] realm. Either way, Greek bishops throughout Europe are furious, seeing this as yet more evidence of the Pope's attempts to establish primacy despite the Council of Chalcedon having clearly placed Constantinople as the seat of Christianity's highest ecclesiastical court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2278;The Pope oversteps [current_roman_pope.GetHerHis] bounds;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2278;There were two Roman Empires before -- what is the problem?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2278;More divisions amongst righteous Christians?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_2278;So the Christians bicker amongst themselves;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2279;The Erosion of Christianity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2279;With the war currently ongoing between [Root.GetTitledName] and [papal_emperor.GetTitledName], questions have begun to rise about the unity of Chalcedonian Christianity. [papal_emperor.GetTitledFirstName] was crowned by the Pope, was [papal_emperor.GetSheHe] not? Does that not make [papal_emperor.GetHerHim] the Pope's champion? Yet here [papal_emperor.GetSheHe] stands, at war with the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] who stands at the center of the eastern Christian faith. Divisions between Latin and Greek Christians have been deepening for years, but this war brings into sharp focus just how bad things have become. More and more, bishops on both sides are talking about a coming schism that could rend Christianity in two.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2279;The [papal_emperor.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] is clearly to blame for this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2279;The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] is clearly to blame for this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2279;This bodes ill for us all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_2279;The coming schism is clearly inevitable;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2280;Adoption of the Filioque;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2280;'And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,\nwho proceeds from the Father and the Son,\nwho with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified.'\n\nThe original Nicene Creed, established at the First Council of Nicaea in 325AD, did not have the phrase 'and the Son' added to 'who proceeds from the Father'. This is referred to as the Filioque, and by the decree of Pope [Root.GetFirstName] it has been added to the creed used by Latin bishops, to underline the importance of the Son in the Trinity...and reoundingly rejected by the vast majority of Greek bishops, who are furious that the Pope did so without calling an ecumenical council. To most, this is yet another example of the growing division between Greek and Latin Christianity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2280;The Pope oversteps [Root.GetHerHis] bounds once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2280;Do they seriously reject the Son's true importance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2280;Surely some kind of compromise can be reached?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2281;Papal Jurisdiction;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2281;A recent rare meeting between [Root.GetTitledFirstName] and [current_patriarch.GetTitledFirstName] in Constantinople to discuss the ecclesiastical jurisdiction over [jurisdiction_realm.GetName] was said to end in near-chaos, with [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] storming out of the cathedral in a fury. The Pope claims that [jurisdiction_realm.GetName] falls within [Root.GetHerHis] rightful domain, while [current_patriarch.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] claims [jurisdiction_realm.GetName] has never been part of either ecclesiastical realm, and that this is yet another example of the Pope striving to assert primacy where it is not warranted. This latest conflict over papal jurisdiction has left both patriarchs almost unwilling to communicate at all, a fact which has left many of their bishops extremely worried.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2281;[jurisdiction_realm.GetName] is its own domain, clearly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2281;So [jurisdiction_realm.GetName] should be left without a proper Patriarch?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2281;This bickering does no-one any good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2282;Conflict Over the Eucharist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2282_greek;A dispute between [Root.GetTitledName] and a number of [Root.GetHerHis] Latin priests has quickly spread to the highest reaches of Christian rule. [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [Root.GetHerHim]self a follower of the Greek rites, took to task a number of priests in [Root.GetHerHis] realm who were using unleavened bread while administering the Eucharist, calling them 'azymites' and ultimately ordering their arrest. The priests complained, outraged, and their anger spread to other Latin realms, resulting in a series of sweeping edicts against several Greek practices. Greek bishops have responded in kind, and while leaders have allowed the matter to blow over, the simmering anger between both sides remains sharp and clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2282_latin;A dispute between [Root.GetTitledName] and a number of [Root.GetHerHis] Greek priests has quickly spread to the highest reaches of Christian rule. [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [Root.GetHerHim]self a follower of the Latin rites, took to task a number of priests in [Root.GetHerHis] realm who were using leavened bread while administering the Eucharist, calling them 'prozymites' and ultimately ordering their arrest. The priests complained, outraged, and their anger spread to other Greek realms, resulting in a series of sweeping edicts against several Latin practices. Latin bishops have responded in kind, and while leaders have allowed the matter to blow over, the simmering anger between both sides remains sharp and clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2282;The Eucharist uses leavened bread -- only!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2282;The Eucharist uses unleavened bread -- only!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2282;All this over bread? Seriously?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2283;The Wicked [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2283;The depredations of [Root.GetTitledName] are renowned throughout the Christian world, [Root.GetHerHis] wickedness having reached such infamy that [other_patriarch.GetTitledFirstName] has called for [Root.GetHerHis] removal from holy office. [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is said to have laughed at this, shocking [Root.GetHerHis] advisors by launching into a tirade over the [other_patriarch.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] within earshot of the [other_patriarch.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]'s envoys. The resulting chill between the Greek and Latin leaders has deepened the already-wide division in Christianity, once again raising the specter of a possible schism within the faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2283;What was the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] thinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2284;Call For Council Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2284;Perhaps fearing the ever-growing rift between the Latin and Greek branches of Christianity, [Root.GetTitledName] issued a call for reconciliation with a new Ecumenical Council in [Root.Capital.GetName]...a call that has been met by [current_patriarch.GetTitledName] with little more than stony silence. For many, this was seen as a last chance to avert what they see as the coming schism. Now all such hope has been quenched, and it is thought to be only a matter of time before the division becomes official.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2284;'Reconciliation', [Root.GetSheHe] calls it? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2284;If it happens, it is on the Ecumenical Patriarch's head;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2284;I suppose we shall have to wait and see;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_2284;Has it truly become so bad between them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2260;Constantinople Overrun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2260;After years of religious conflict in Byzantium, it seems heretics have prevailed against Greek Rite Chalcedonians. Heretic [current_patriarch.GetTitledName] now completely controls the Church in the east and is fully suported by the Greek Emperor. Now, it is no longer possible to avert the coming schism, and it is thought to be only a matter of time before the division becomes official.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2260;There's nothing we can do about it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2260;Cursed heretics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2260;I suppose we shall have to wait and see;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_2260;This is none of our concern;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
